# Unit tests for pure algorithms

## Description

Write unit tests which confirm that every function under the +in (sets), by (maps), and +to (queues) arms behaves as intended. These functions can be found in sections 2h, 2i, and 2k of the Hoon standard library, respectively. They are located in /sys/hoon.hoon.

Also write unit tests for the functions under the +differ arm in /sys/zuse.hoon. These functions are a suite of Hunt-McIlroy diff and merge algorithms.

Save the test files in the /tests/sys/hoon directory in Arvo. Use the same framework as the files that already exist in /tests.
